This project is my practice learning vanilla javascript following the tutorial of SuperSimple.dev.
This helps me to build fundamental knowledge in front end development that I will apply in some framework in the future.

JS concepts applied:
-Page rendering using javascript
-Modules (import/export of variables)
-OOP paradigm
-Async and await function
-Understanding promises
-MVC architecture
